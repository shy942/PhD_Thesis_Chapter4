The image displays a login page for a website or application. At the top, there is a horizontal dark-colored navigation bar with the text "ProjectName" on the left and a hamburger menu icon on the right. Below this bar is a yellow notification banner containing a message indicating that the user account has been locked due to invalid login attempts, with instructions to wait and try again later. Below the notification, there is a "Login" heading, under which are two fields: one for "User name or email address" with the input "john" filled in, and another for "Password" which is currently empty. Below the password field is a checkbox labeled "Remember me." At the bottom, there are two buttons: a blue "Login" button on the left and a gray "Register" button on the right.
