* Your Abp package version : v3.7.2
* Your base framework:  Net Core 2.1.

### Step
Use any Repository,then call the FirstOrDefaultAsync(TPrimaryKey id) or FirstOrDefault(TPrimaryKey id) method **many times** with **different id**.
### Result
In my application.a service call the FirstOrDefaultAsync(Guid id) for about 55k times in two days. the application took about 1GB memory.
### Reason
I use the memory profile tool to check the dump file. I found ef cache the different query plan many times.

Then I found https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/10535#issuecomment-375116203 explan the reason.
Then I check the abp source code,https://github.com/aspnetboilerplate/aspnetboilerplate/blob/cb0626b58670e123787c7884aafb3758fb6e3ba6/src/Abp/Domain/Repositories/AbpRepositoryBase.cs#L262
It creates different Expression with different id.

### How to fix it
I switch to call the FirstOrDefaultAsync(Expression<Func<TEntity, bool>> predicate) method.the memory leak was gone.
But I think we need change the CreateEqualityExpressionForId method to create a same expression with same entity but different ids.
