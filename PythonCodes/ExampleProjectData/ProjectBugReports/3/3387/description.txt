Hello.
The [documentation](https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/Localization#xml-files) contains a [screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aspnetboilerplate/aspnetboilerplate/master/doc/WebSite/images/localization_files2.png) of the XML localization files. A little lower, note indicates the inadmissibility of using a dot in file names, but the screenshot show file name with a dot. I corrected the image a bit and it would be nice to bring the image in line with the text.
