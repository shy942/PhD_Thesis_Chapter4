The image displays an open Integrated Development Environment (IDE) window consisting of several open files from a C# project. The main editor window shows a C# class file named "EntityAuditingHelper.cs". The code snippet is for a method that sets modification audit properties on an entity object. The code is highlighted and includes various conditional statements, method calls, and type declarations typical for a software project. The top menu bar and several toolbars of the IDE are visible, with icons for common actions such as saving, debugging, and version control. The left sidebar shows the "Solution Explorer" and "Git Changes". The bottom status bar displays information about the IDE's state, such as network connectivity, synchronization status, CPU usage, and weather.
