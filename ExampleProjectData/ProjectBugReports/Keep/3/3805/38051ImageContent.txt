NETSDK1061: The project was restored using Microsoft.NETCore.App
version 2.1.3, but with current settings, version 2.1.3-servicing-26724-03
would be used instead. To resolve this issue, make sure the same settings
are used for restore and for subsequent operations such as build or
publish. Typically this issue can occur if the RuntimeIdentifier property
is set during build or publish but not during restore. For more information,
see https://aka.ms/dotnet-runtime-patch-selection.
