The image shows a file navigation hierarchy, typically from an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or file explorer. The hierarchy starts with a folder labeled "Localization." Within this folder, there is another subfolder named "AbpWeb." Inside "AbpWeb," there is a subfolder named "SimpleTaskSystem," which is highlighted. Within the "SimpleTaskSystem" folder, there are two XML files: "SimpleTaskSystem-tr.xml" and "SimpleTaskSystem.xml." The folder icons are tan folders, and the XML file icons include a small blue lock, indicating these files may be read-only or otherwise secured.
