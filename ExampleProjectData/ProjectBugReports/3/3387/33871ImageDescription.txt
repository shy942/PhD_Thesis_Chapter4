The image shows a section of a file directory tree from what appears to be an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or a file explorer. The directory tree is expanded to show the contents within folders. At the top level is a folder named "Localization," indicated by a folder icon. It contains a subfolder named "AbpWeb," which in turn contains another subfolder named "SimpleTaskSystem." This latter folder is highlighted, suggesting it is currently selected. Within the "SimpleTaskSystem" folder, two XML files are listed: "SimpleTaskSystem-tr.xml" and "SimpleTaskSystem.xml." Each file is preceded by an icon that looks like a document with a small globe, possibly indicating language or localization files.
