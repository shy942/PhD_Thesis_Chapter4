Dears,
All of my integration tests got broken after upgrade from version 5.5.0 to latest version 7.0.0
After debugging my tests, I can see the root cause of the issue is this line:-
    `protected virtual void SetCreationAuditProperties(object entityAsObj, long? userId) => EntityAuditingHelper.SetCreationAuditProperties(this.MultiTenancyConfig, entityAsObj, this.AbpSession.TenantId, userId, this.CurrentUnitOfWorkProvider?.Current?.AuditFieldConfiguration);`
in automation tests, **CurrentUnitOfWorkProvider?.Current** is null so, the **auditFields** of type **IReadOnlyList<AuditFieldConfiguration>** will be null and that break all of my tests. This was working properly before upgrade
