When using `module-zero-core-template`, I noticed an issue when users try to change the theme multiple times and the `Setting` is not found to said user. In said cases, multiple rows are inserted in AbpSetting, creating duplicates.

I would like to know if it makes sense to set a unique constraint / alternate key to such table and implement a way of validating if said row already exists on the table on INSERT.

I have faced similar issues using EFCore and SQL Server on my own projects and have implemented the following code:

```
// ....
try
{
    _repository.Insert(entity);
}
catch (DbUpdateException ex)
{
    if (ex.InnerException is SqlException innerException &&
        (innerException.Number == 2601 || innerException.Number == 2627))
    {
        return await FindOrCreateAsync(entity.TenantId, entity.UserId, entity.Name);
    }

    throw;
}
```

Example of such issue:
