Hi, I tried to configure sourcelink following all steps detailed into this thread but it doesn´t work. I am using ABP 5.2.0 and VS 2019. when I tried to get the symbols into local cache it couldn´t download any ABP´s pdb file.

You can see the debug configuration bellow. Please could you help me with this issue?
